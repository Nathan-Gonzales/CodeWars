<!--- Screenshot Here --->
A repository containing all of the codewars challenges I do to keep my coding skills sharp.


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

Everyday I solve a CodeWars problem or two to kickstart the day!

## Optimizations

I often come back to old problems to refactor and optimize my code. It is great to see how much I learned since I originally solved the problem.

## Lessons Learned:

What I learned from solving these problems daily is the power of consistency. If you stay consistent with something no matter how difficult it gets you will find yourself so much further than you realized you could go.
