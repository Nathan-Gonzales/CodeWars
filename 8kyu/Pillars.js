   Problem:     Pillars

   Description: There are pillars near the road. 
   The distance between the pillars is the same and the width of the pillars is the same. 
   Your function accepts three arguments:
    number of pillars (â‰¥ 1);
    distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);
    width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).

   Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters (without the width of the first and last pillar).

   Input -> Output Examples: 
    pillars(1, 10, 10)  -> 0
    pillars(2, 20, 25)  -> 2000
    pillars(11, 15, 30) -> 15270
*/


//  Solution: 
function pillars(numPill, dist, width) {
    if(numPill === 1){
      return 0
    }
    return ((numPill - 1) * dist * 100) + ((numPill - 2) * width)
}
